## **Making a New Release**
To create and publish a new release of the package to PyPI:

1. **Update the Version:**
   - Update the version in your `pyproject.toml` file following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), e.g., `0.0.1` â†’ `0.1.0` for a minor update.

2. **Commit the Changes:**
   - Commit and push the version update to the main branch:
     ```sh
     git add pyproject.toml
     git commit -m "Bump version to vX.Y.Z"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Create a Tag:**
   - Tag the commit with the new version:
     ```sh
     git tag vX.Y.Z
     git push origin vX.Y.Z
     ```

   Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the actual version number.

4. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - When the tag is pushed, the `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
      - Build the package using Poetry.
      - Publish the package to PyPI.

5. **Confirm the Release:**
   - Check [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jup-ag-sdk/) to ensure the new version has been published successfully.
